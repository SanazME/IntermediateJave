1) Create a DAO for your CustomerService if you haven't already done so.

2) Create a copy of the DAO.

3) Create an interface and have both DAO's implement that interface.

4) Create a Factory that you can use to inject the DAO into your CustomerService.
   In this iteration you can hard code the type the Factory returns.

5) Change the hardcoded type in the Factory to make sure your system
   both daos.

6) Implement a properties based mechanism to decide which DAO you are going
   to use.
